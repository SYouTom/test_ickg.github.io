    <p>The annual IEEE International Conference on Knowledge Graph (ICKG) provides a premier international forum for presentation of original research results in knowledge discovery and graph learning, discussion of opportunities and challenges, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative, practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of knowledge discovery from data, with a strong focus on graph learning and knowledge graph, including algorithms, software, platforms.</p>
    
    <p>ICKG 2026 intends to draw researchers and application developers from a wide range of areas such as knowledge engineering, representation learning, big data analytics, statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, data mining, knowledge visualization, high performance computing, and World Wide Web etc. By promoting novel, high quality research findings, and innovative solutions to address challenges in handling all aspects of learning from data with dependency relationship.</p>
    
    <p>All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Awards</strong>, including Best Paper, Best Paper Runner up, Best Student Paper, Best Student Paper Runner up, will be conferred at the conference, with a check and a certificate for each award.</p>
    
    <p>The conference also features a <strong>survey track</strong> to accept survey papers reviewing recent studies in all aspects of knowledge discovery and graph learning.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Special Track Topics</h3>
    <p>Each special track is handled by respective special track chairs, and the papers are also included in the conference proceedings.</p>
    <ul class="topic-list">
        <li><strong>Special Track 01:</strong> KGC and Knowledge Graph Building</li>
        <li><strong>Special Track 02:</strong> KR and KG Reasoning</li>
        <li><strong>Special Track 03:</strong> KG and Large Language Model</li>
        <li><strong>Special Track 04:</strong> GNN and Graph Learning</li>

        <li><strong>Special Track 07:</strong> KG and Knowledge Fusion</li>
        <li><strong>Special Track 08:</strong> Industry and Applications</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p>Paper submissions should be no longer than <strong>8 pages</strong>, in the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">IEEE 2-column format</a>, including the bibliography and any possible appendices. Submissions longer than 8 pages will be rejected without review. All submissions will be reviewed by the Program Committee based on technical quality, originality, significance, and clarity.</p>
    
    <p><strong>For Survey Track Papers:</strong> Please preface the descriptive paper title with “<strong>Survey:</strong>”, followed by the actual paper title. For example, a paper entitled “A Literature Review of Streaming Knowledge Graph”, should be changed as “Survey: A Literature Review of Streaming Knowledge Graph”. This is for the reviewers and chairs to clearly bid and handle the papers. Once the paper is accepted, the word, such as “Survey:”, can be removed from the camera-ready copy.</p>

    <p><strong>For Special Track Papers:</strong> Please preface the descriptive paper title with “<strong>SS##:</strong>”, where “##” is the two digits special track ID. For example, a paper entitled “Incremental Knowledge Graph Learning”, intended to target Special Track 01 (Machine learning and knowledge graph) should be changed as “SS01: Incremental Knowledge Graph Learning”.</p>

    <p>All manuscripts are submitted as full papers and are reviewed based on their scientific merit. The reviewing process is <strong>single blind</strong>, meaning that each submission should list all authors and affiliations. There is no separate abstract submission step. There are no separate industrial, application, or poster tracks. Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in the online submission system. No email submission is accepted.</p>
